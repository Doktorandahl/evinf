# Tidy function for poissonboot

Tidy function for poissonboot

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'poissonboot'
tidy(
  x,
  coef_type = c("original", "bootstrap_mean", "bootstrap_median"),
  standard_error = TRUE,
  p_value = c("bootstrapped", "approx", "none"),
  confint = c("none", "bootstrapped", "approx"),
  conf_level = 0.95,
  approx_t_value = TRUE,
  symmetric_bootstrap_p = TRUE,
  include_ylev = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A fitted bootstrapped Poisson model

- coef_type:

  What type of coefficient should be reported, original, bootstrapped
  mean, or bootstrapped median

- standard_error:

  Should bootstrapped standard errors be reported?

- p_value:

  What type of p-value should be reported? Bootstrapped p_values,
  approximate p-values, or none?

- confint:

  What type of confidence intervals should be reported? Bootstrapped
  p_values, approximate p-values, or none?

- conf_level:

  Confidence level for confidence intervals

- approx_t_value:

  Should approximate t_values be reported

- symmetric_bootstrap_p:

  Should bootstrap p-values be computed as symmetric (leaving alpha/2
  percent in each tail)? FALSE gives non-symmetric, but narrower,
  intervals. TRUE corresponds most closely to conventional p-values.

- include_ylev:

  Logical. Should y.lev be included in the tidy output? Makes for nicer
  tables when using modelsummary

- ...:

  Other arguments to be passed to tidy

## Value

A tidy function for a bootstrapped Poisson model

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
data(genevzinb2)
model <- evzinb(y~x1+x2+x3,data=genevzinb2, family = "poisson", n_bootstraps = 5)

#> Warning: C_EV equalled the lower endpoint (173) in 4 of 5 bootstrap replicates; consider widening c.lim.
